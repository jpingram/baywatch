3rd of May [11:50AM] - started foundational work on BayWatch project (working title)
	created basic classes
		-Controller
		-Ticket
		-Box
		-Rect (copied from Pheonix project)
			added containsPoint function (currently untested)
	copied data.cpp/data.h from Pheonix project (to make 'freeroad' font usable)
	functions and headers for each class are defined
	main.cpp skeleton exists but no functionality yet
	primary goal for first stage is to implement box selection via mouse input
3rd of May [3:08PM] - finished build 0.1 (foundation and box selection)
	multiple boxes are able to be displayed
	clicking on a box with the mouse selects it
		also unselects other box(es) if another box was already selected
		selected boxes are red, unselected boxes are white
		added mouse coordinate debug text
3rd of May [4:19PM] - added 'select status' system
	required updates to box.h, box.cpp, and controller.cpp
	clicked on an already selected box now updates that boxes 'select status'
		standby->stage1->stage2->stage3->stage1->[...etc]
4th of May [12:34PM] - reorganized data structures
	added notes (string) instance varable to Ticket
	'ticket' in Box changed to 'tickets'
		now a vector<Ticket'>
		updated display objects in Controller to accomondate
	added label (string) instance variable to Box
	reorganized methods in Box
	created ticketQueue (vector<Ticket>) in Controller
	create Text and RectangleShape object vectors for the ticket queue
		created create and update methods to accomondate
	updated main to draw queue text and rectangle objects
	started research on SFGUI (for processing inputs)
		downloaded CMake
4th of May [3:18PM] - basic ticket info insertion (incomplete)
	created TicketBucket object to store tickets with associated statistics
		only stat right now is box number
	changed ticketQueue to a vector<TicketBucket>
	added addTicket() and removeTicket() functions to Box and Controller
		added isIdUnique() in Controller
	tested info input manually
	TicketBucket queue works, references to tickets in Box causes seg. faults
	SEE LINES:
		Controller.cpp, Line 101: adds ticket pointer to box
		Controller.cpp, Line 208: displays ticket ID of first ticket in box
	seq. fault happening on line 208
		a case of pointer losing scope/expected value is suspected
		most likely caused by line 101
7th of May [11:21PM] - basic ticket info insertion (complete)
	changed addTicket function in box to create a new Ticket object on call
		boxes now create and destroy tickets in their own scope
		changed box.h and removeTicket in box.cpp accordingly
	tested ticket adding and removing in Controller manually
	added function setBoxNum in Controller to switch tickets from box to box
	added functionality to select TicketBuckets in queue using the mouse
		added 'selected' bool in TicketBucket with appropriate getter/setter
		added bucket selection methods/instance variables to Controller
		modified queue display objects to display selected bucket
